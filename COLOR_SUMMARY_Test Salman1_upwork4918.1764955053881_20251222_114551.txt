  8. RCM will help
  9. also need to look at other risks - intensity, frequency , duration
 10. cant be a separate doc
 11. embed into renewal process
 12. building resiliece through existing processes
 13. we know this is coming down the line -
 14. working with the unions to agree this - link to pay discussions
 15. would it be nation al or TfW - need for flexible staff - expectations about being called in if you have more time off
 16. when it fails, RCM that is resilient to higher temperature
 17. so dont need maintenance staff going on track
 18. RCM starts to fail at 40
 19. linked to HR and working conditions and expetctations of staff (and safety)

DARK RED STICKY NOTES (21 items)
============================================================

  1. increased waste management - would be a fire risk and smell -
  2. fire risk on trains
  3. if lift out of use - no back up exit other than stairs - fit for purpose of site
  4. commercial risk - people wont use the service
  5. people struggle with heat - people loosing it - pasengers, esp with alcohol
  6. Main Newport road would be affected by any derailment
  7. e.g. expansion of glass happens in a range - if exceeded the glass with crack
  8. increased urban heat island effect
  9. additional demand on the grid - DNOs - as things get hotter - when over a certain current rating it will trip
 10. building materials lose reliabiity under hotter temps - insulating materials, cladding, on the station building - e.g. GRP - loose performance - if they are installed in 5 years and not future proofed -
 11. system overheating and unable to perform at required capacity
 12. heat not currntly seen as a reason to stop trains
 13. shelter - increasingly insufficient
 14. risk of fire on the track- hydraulic oil -
 15. review design heat - 40degrees
 16. increased buckling -increased chance of derailment
 17. OLE will be hotter - boards will fail at 90 degrees - will power off - system not able to cope - solder mets - needs cooling
 18. cant let the OLE fail
 19. batteries - no electrification so if equipment failure trains get stranded and depend on batteries for air con
 20. Ninions Park and Cathays stretch without overhead wire (dependent on battery) - how new rolling stock recharge from cable - if loop not complet - overhead rail not functioning. Exposed areas. neeeds modelling.

ORANGE STICKY NOTES (26 items)
============================================================

  1. materials more resilience to range of heat
  2. colour of infrastructure - reflective, white, painting rails white
  3. GCRE -global centre fror Rail Excellence
  4. testing new ideas - e.g. pros and cons of green rooves
  5. welfare facilities - access to water
  6. working with first responders, fire services
  7. new comms plan - thinking about messgaing and channels

 14. max effeciecy of the workforce - wearing shorts, PPE, working from home, ice packs
 15. changing the standards - RSSB - mindset shift 40 degrees too low
 16. understand the effect of heat on components - research on e.g. effective use of drones and RCM
 17. TfW possible develop new standards but working with RSSB
 18. modelling how existing fleet will perform wirth batteries - is it designed for 40degree - how cope with 47 degrees?
 19. review resilience of high risk components - what can cope/ not cope

UNKNOWN STICKY NOTES (57 items)
============================================================

  1. costs increase
  2. fatality increase for saftey and maintenace
